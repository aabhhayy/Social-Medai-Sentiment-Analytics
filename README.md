# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analytics
1.🌐Social Media Sentiment Analytics: Understand public opinion globally

2.This project involved analyzing global social media data to identify and classify user sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed using Python to remove noise and standardize the text. After data preparation, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created featuring dynamic visuals like pie charts, bar graphs, slicers, and KPIs. The dashboard allows users to explore sentiment distribution across different countries and categories, making it easier to understand public opinion and emotional trends on a global scale.

.🐍 Python – For data cleaning, preprocessing, and handling large datasets efficiently.
.📊 Power BI – To create an interactive and visually rich dashboard for presenting insights.
.📁 CSV/Excel – Used as the source and export format for structured data handling.
.📓 Jupyter Notebook – For writing, testing, and documenting Python code in an organized way.
.🐼 Pandas – Simplifies data manipulation, filtering, and analysis.
.📈 Matplotlib / Seaborn – Used for quick EDA and data visualizations before building the dashboard.
